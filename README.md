# Polling and Election Data Analysis

## What are the likely the best predictors of the 2020 presidential election?

In this project, the group will be analyzing historical and demographic data from previous elections. 

Beginning the analysis, the group has looked at swing states from previous elections. (insert what trends we have found or any additional information)

(This section could be called "Beginning the Analysis"
We could move the section to Historical Data. ) 

### Historical Data
Which states are generally the best at predicting the presidential winner?
Ex: Swing States
How do third party vote shares cut into election victories?

### Demographics 
How does age play who votes and who wins elections?
Which groups vote a higher percentage of the time?
How does voter turnout impact elections?
Whose votes count the most (i.e. voting power) and how do they predict the winner?
Predictors of elections victories by ...
Race, gender, education level, age, income level
### Additional factors to take into consideration: 
How do approval ratings go into an election impact the outcome?
How do positive/negative news stories close to the election date impact outcomes?
How does % of votes-by-mail predict or impact election outcomes?


 ### Objectives

 #### From Project 1 the group has been able to:

 -  Draw and interpret diagrams of collaborative Git branching workflows.
 -  Create new branches with Git.
 -  Push local branches to GitHub.
 -  Pull upstream changes from GitHub.
 - Pull from the appropriate branch(es) on GitHub.
 - Merge their branches into their local main on the command line.
 - Resolve merge conflicts on their computers.
 - Request the integration of their changes via PR.
 - Approve and merge PRs from GitHub.
 - Git stash to save "dirty" changes to their working environment.
